# Audio Files Directory

This directory will contain the audio narration files for each chapter.

Expected files:
- scene1_1.mp3 - Chapter 1, Stage 1 narration
- scene1_2.mp3 - Chapter 1, Stage 2 narration
- scene1_3.mp3 - Chapter 1, Stage 3 narration
- scene2_1.mp3 - Chapter 2, Stage 1 narration
... and so on for all chapters

Note: Audio files should be optimized for web delivery (compressed, appropriate bitrate)
Voice should be clear, engaging, and appropriate for middle/high school students.
